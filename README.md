# Grid Hop

Grid Hop is a fun puzzle game where every move counts. Start from the edge of a colorful grid and leap across tiles, each marked with a number showing exactly how far you can jump. Your mission: reach the Goal tile in the fewest moves possible.

It sounds simple, but with each new game, the board is randomly generated, offering endless replayability and fresh challenges.
